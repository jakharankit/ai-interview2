  BAD: "The candidate demonstrates understanding of dictionary concepts. However, the explanation lacks clarity and precision."

"modelAnswer": (how a real person would answer — casual but correct, 2-4 sentences)
  GOOD: "I'd create a dictionary like students = {101: 'Alice', 102: 'Bob'} — roll numbers as keys, names as values. To look someone up, just do students[101] and you get 'Alice'. Dictionaries are perfect for this kind of quick lookup."

"improvements": 2-3 items
